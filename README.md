For instructions on using vislam, please refer to [Qualcomm Snapdragon Flight VISLAM-ROS Sample Code](https://github.com/ATLFlight/ros-examples).

In this repository, I added a trajectory topic (vislam/path) which can be viewed in RVIZ, and an image preview (vislam/image) for the image captured through camera.
